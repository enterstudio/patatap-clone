# Enhancement Plans
While patatap is a simple clone and just a play app I would like to create some enhancements to realign it with what's currently on patatap and possily even enhance this to go a different way
I have no real ETA on when I'll be able to come back and complete this so I will lay out a high level plan

## New
- Add header and footer
  + header and footer will be the same as the pages header footer and will link back there
- Inclue some way of cycling through sounds
  + Originally we had a lot of different sound files. will think of possibly adding some way of selecting which sound file we want
  > this will have to be done in such a way that it can be rendered on a static page; this could be tricky
- Add support for other keys as currently only supporting a-z
